IBM DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT
Objectives of the Analysis
1. Understand Current Turnover Rates: Gain a comprehensive understanding of
the current employee turnover rate and analyze the demographic distribution of
attrition by age, gender, education, department, and job role.
2. Identify Key Factors Influencing Turnover: Examine the main factors
contributing to employee attrition, including job satisfaction indicators (job
involvement and work-life balance), salary factors (monthly income and salary
hikes), and benefit factors (stock option levels), to uncover patterns and
correlations that drive higher attrition rates.
